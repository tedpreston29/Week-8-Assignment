Added header and footer on my root layout page which will wrap all other pages and inserted {children} into it to show the Home Page on page load... also added an enter button on my Home Page with a link to main games library

Added my database query to my main game library to fetch all the games images and titles and displayed them on the page using .map. Each image has a Link element to an individual game page that shows cheats.

added a query on my dynamic route to fetch individual games and their corrosponding cheats.

added another route to a form submission page from my dynamic route. This route displays the games image and some form fields for a user to submit a new cheat... I found this quite difficult to figure out as I am still struggling getting my head around params and how it all links together.

Add a like/dislike button... check out the 08-server-functions-forms example
